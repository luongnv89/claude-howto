# Changelog

## [v2.1.212] — 2026-07-18

### Synced to Claude Code v2.1.212

Bumps tutorial coverage from the v2.1.206 baseline (2026-07-11 sync) to
v2.1.212, plus a repo-internal accuracy audit that surfaced defects
independent of the version delta.

### Fixed

- **Dead `#` memory-shortcut removed** — `02-memory/README.md` documented a
  `#`-prefix quick-memory-add pattern in two places ("Method 3" and an
  "Example 4" walkthrough) as a working feature, directly contradicting the
  file's own commands table three lines from the top, which already marked
  `#` **Discontinued**. Both sections were removed/rewritten to point at
  `/memory` and conversational memory requests instead.
- **Auto mode opt-in → opt-out on Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry (v2.1.207)** — auto
  mode is now available by default on these providers (plus signed-in Claude
  apps gateway sessions) for Sonnet 5, Opus 4.7/4.8, and Fable 5; the
  `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE` opt-in flag has no effect from v2.1.207
  onward. Fixed in `09-advanced-features/README.md` and `10-cli/README.md`.
- **`auto` permission mode mislabeled "Research Preview"** — current official
  docs present `auto` as GA (available on all plans, gated only by model and
  provider eligibility), not a preview feature. Corrected across
  `09-advanced-features/README.md`, `CATALOG.md`, and `README.md`, which also
  gained the missing `auto` row in its permission-mode summary.
- **`/fork` / `/branch` history corrected** — the repo claimed "`/fork`
  renamed to `/branch` in v2.1.77 (alias retained)." Current docs show these
  are distinct, current commands: `/fork` spawns a background subagent that
  inherits the conversation, `/branch` switches you into a copy in place.
  They were a single aliased command only from v2.1.77 to v2.1.161. Fixed in
  `01-slash-commands/README.md` and `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- **`effort` frontmatter enum completed** — `04-subagents/README.md` listed
  4 levels (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`max`), missing `xhigh`, present in every
  other file that documents this enum.
- **Bundled-skills count reconciled** — `CATALOG.md`'s summary table said "9
  bundled" against its own 10-row detail table; corrected to 10 (16 total).
- **`INDEX.md` Feature Coverage Matrix fully recomputed** — header claimed "16
  files," the Skills row claimed "28" for the same category; neither matched
  the actual 21 files across the six documented skills. The Plugins row
  similarly summed to 36 but showed 40. Every row was recounted by hand; the
  Skills row now reads `5 | 9 | 7` (**21**) and the Plugins row now reads
  `11 | 9 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 7` (**39**) — every row's Total now equals the sum
  of its own cells.
- **Stale `2.1.160` footer cluster bumped** — five files
  (`08-checkpoints/checkpoint-examples.md`,
  `09-advanced-features/planning-mode-examples.md`, and the three
  `07-plugins/*/README.md` example-package files) still carried June 2026
  footers with no version-specific content drift found; bumped to 2.1.212.
- **`QUICK_REFERENCE.md` fully resynced** — was 52 versions behind at
  `2.1.160`/June 2. Permission-mode block updated to `manual`
  (formerly `default`), Compatible Models gained Sonnet 5, and the "New
  Features (May 2026)" section was retitled and refreshed.
- **`02-memory/README.md` Memory Hierarchy section rewritten** — replaced a
  fabricated 8-tier strict-precedence model with the verified structure:
  CLAUDE.md files and rules are concatenated into context (not selected by
  override), and `managed-settings.d/` is a `settings.json` mechanism, not a
  CLAUDE.md one. The Memory Architecture diagram was also corrected — it
  previously conflated claude.ai's 24h synthesis cycle with Claude Code's
  continuous auto memory.

### Added

- **Subagent output scanning (v2.1.210)** — Claude Code scans subagent
  reports for prompt-injection patterns (fake system tags, fabricated
  conversation turns, permission-bypass mentions) and neutralizes them.
  Documented in a new subsection of `04-subagents/README.md`.
- **Session-wide spawn caps (v2.1.212)** — default 200/session limits on
  WebSearch calls (`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_WEB_SEARCHES_PER_SESSION`) and subagent
  spawns (`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENTS_PER_SESSION`, reset by `/clear`).
  Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`, `04-subagents/README.md`,
  and `10-cli/README.md`.
- **MCP long-running-tool auto-backgrounding (v2.1.212)** — MCP tool calls
  over 2 minutes now auto-background instead of blocking the session;
  configurable via `CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_AUTO_BACKGROUND_MS`. Documented in
  `05-mcp/README.md`.
- **`claude auto-mode reset` and `/resume` picker (v2.1.212)** — a new CLI
  subcommand restores default auto-mode config; bare `/resume` now opens a
  picker of past sessions (including removed ones) and resumes as a
  background session. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`,
  `01-slash-commands/README.md`, and `10-cli/README.md`.
- **Screen reader mode (v2.1.208)** — opt-in plain-text rendering via
  `--ax-screen-reader`, `CLAUDE_AX_SCREEN_READER=1`, or `"axScreenReader":
  true`. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md` and
  `10-cli/README.md`.
- **Task tool `mode` parameter deprecation (v2.1.212)** — noted in
  `04-subagents/README.md`: subagents now inherit the parent session's
  permission mode by default; the Task tool's per-call `mode` parameter is
  ignored.

### Known gaps (deferred, not fixed this sync)

- `03-skills/.claude/skills/blog-draft/` is gitignored local testing scratch
  (`# Local skill testing` in `03-skills/.gitignore`), not a tracked
  duplicate of `03-skills/blog-draft/` — confirmed no action needed.

## [v2.1.160] — 2026-06-02

### Synced to Claude Code v2.1.160

Bumps tutorial coverage to the Claude Code v2.1.160 release. The intervening
v2.1.156 sync (Claude Opus 4.8, #129) was applied to the docs but not separately
changelogged; this entry continues from there and covers the v2.1.157–v2.1.160
delta. No breaking changes shipped in this range — the additions are a handful
of new CLI/feature surfaces plus the routine footer bump. Auto mode on
third-party providers is **opt-in**, not a new default.

### Added

- **`claude plugin init <name>` (v2.1.157)** — scaffolds a new plugin directly
  in `.claude/skills`; plugins placed there now auto-load with no marketplace
  required. Documented in `10-cli/README.md`, `07-plugins/README.md`, and
  `CATALOG.md`.
- **Auto mode on Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry (v2.1.158)** — auto mode is now
  available on the three third-party providers for Opus 4.7/4.8, **opt-in** via
  the `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE=1` environment variable. Documented in
  `09-advanced-features/README.md`, `10-cli/README.md`, and `CATALOG.md`.
- **`EnterWorktree` mid-session switching (v2.1.157)** — the `EnterWorktree`
  tool can now switch between Claude-managed worktrees within a session, and
  finished worktrees are left unlocked so `git worktree remove`/`prune` can
  clean them up. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.

### Behavior changes

- **`acceptEdits` write-safety prompts (v2.1.160)** — even in `acceptEdits`
  mode, Claude Code now prompts before writing shell-startup files (`.zshenv`,
  `.zlogin`, `.bash_login`, `~/.config/git/`) and code-executing build configs
  (`.npmrc`, `.yarnrc*`, `bunfig.toml`, `.bazelrc`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`,
  `.devcontainer/`), which could otherwise lead to unintended command
  execution. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- **Dynamic-workflow trigger keyword `workflow` → `ultracode` (v2.1.160)** — the
  bare word "workflow" no longer triggers a dynamic-workflow run; the trigger
  keyword is now `ultracode`. Noted in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.

### Removed

- **`CLAUDE_CODE_OPUS_4_6_FAST_MODE_OVERRIDE` is now a no-op (v2.1.160)** — the
  environment variable was removed and now has no effect. The env-var table
  wording in `10-cli/README.md` was updated from "removed 2026-06-01" to
  "Removed (no-op as of v2.1.160)".

### Documentation

- Fixed three internally-inconsistent version strings in `README.md` (badge and
  FAQ prose were stuck at `2.1.145` / `v2.1.150`) and normalized a stale Sources
  link.
- Bumped every English doc's metadata footer to **v2.1.160 / June 2, 2026** for
  a consistent sync.

## [v2.1.150] — 2026-05-25

### Synced to Claude Code v2.1.150

Bumps tutorial coverage from Claude Code v2.1.145 → v2.1.150 (May 23, 2026
release). Anthropic shipped five patches (v2.1.146 through v2.1.150) since the
last sync. The headline change is the **rename of the bundled `/simplify`
skill to `/code-review`** (v2.1.146) — a pure rename with **no alias**, so the
old name no longer works. Because this repo also ships its own local
code-review skill, the directory was renamed to `code-review-specialist` to
avoid shadowing the new built-in. Other highlights: `/usage` now breaks costs
down per category, background sessions can be pinned with `Ctrl+T`, the
markdown renderer supports GFM task-list checkboxes, and a new
`allowAllClaudeAiMcps` managed setting was added. This sync also catches up
four module READMEs (`04-subagents`, `05-mcp`, `07-plugins`,
`09-advanced-features`) that were still pinned to v2.1.143.

### Behavior changes

- **`/simplify` renamed to `/code-review` (v2.1.146)**: the bundled review
  skill is now invoked as `/code-review` and takes an optional effort level
  (e.g. `/code-review high`); pass `--comment` to post findings as inline
  GitHub PR comments (v2.1.147). The old `/simplify` name no longer works —
  there is no alias. Updated in `01-slash-commands/README.md`,
  `03-skills/README.md`, `CATALOG.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, and
  `claude_concepts_guide.md`.

### Changed

- **Renamed the repo's local `code-review` skill to `code-review-specialist`**
  to avoid colliding with the new built-in `/code-review`. The directory
  `03-skills/code-review/` → `03-skills/code-review-specialist/`, and all
  install commands, directory trees, and cross-references were updated in
  `README.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `INDEX.md`, `CATALOG.md`,
  `LEARNING-ROADMAP.md`, `claude_concepts_guide.md`, and `03-skills/README.md`.
  Added a note explaining the collision and how to avoid shadowing the
  built-in.

### Added

- **`/usage` per-category cost breakdown (v2.1.149)** — the cost view now
  breaks spending down by category (skills, subagents, plugins, and
  per-MCP-server costs). Documented in `CATALOG.md` and
  `claude_concepts_guide.md`.
- **Pinned background sessions — `Ctrl+T` (v2.1.147)** — pinning a session in
  `claude agents` keeps it alive when idle, restarts it in place to apply
  Claude Code updates, and sheds it under memory pressure only after
  non-pinned sessions. Documented in `10-cli/README.md`.
- **GFM task-list checkbox rendering (v2.1.149)** — the markdown renderer now
  renders `- [ ]` / `- [x]` as checkboxes. Documented in
  `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- **`allowAllClaudeAiMcps` managed setting (v2.1.149)** — permits loading
  claude.ai cloud MCP connectors organization-wide. Documented in
  `05-mcp/README.md`.

### Removed

- **Stop/SubagentStop hook input fields `background_tasks` and `session_crons`**
  — removed from `06-hooks/README.md` and `resources.md`. These were added from
  the v2.1.145 release notes but are not enumerated in the official hooks
  reference page; removed to keep the docs aligned with the published
  reference.

### Documentation

- Caught up four module READMEs from v2.1.143 to v2.1.150:
  `04-subagents/README.md`, `05-mcp/README.md`, `07-plugins/README.md`,
  `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- Bumped every English doc's metadata footer to **v2.1.150 / May 25, 2026** for
  a consistent sync.

## [v2.1.145] — 2026-05-20

### Synced to Claude Code v2.1.145

Bumps tutorial coverage from Claude Code v2.1.143 → v2.1.145 (May 19, 2026
release). Anthropic shipped two patches (v2.1.144 and v2.1.145) since the last
sync. Highlights: the `/extra-usage` rename to `/usage-credits`, `/model`
becoming session-only by default, three new bundled skills (`/run`, `/verify`,
`/run-skill-generator`), Stop/SubagentStop hook input fields
`background_tasks` and `session_crons`, `claude agents --json` for scripting,
and a security fix that closes the bare-env-var Bash auto-approve loophole.
This sync also catches up six root-level reference docs
(`LEARNING-ROADMAP.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `INDEX.md`, `resources.md`,
`claude_concepts_guide.md`, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`) that were missed in the
v2.1.143 sync and were still pinned to v2.1.138.

### Added

- `/usage-credits` slash command (v2.1.144) — replaces `/extra-usage` as the
  primary name; `/extra-usage` still works as an alias. Documented in
  `01-slash-commands/README.md` and `CATALOG.md`.
- Three new bundled skills (v2.1.145) — `/run` (launches the project's app to
  see a change running), `/verify` (builds, runs, and observes the app to
  confirm a fix works), `/run-skill-generator` (teaches `/run`/`/verify` how
  to handle a specific project by generating a per-project skill). Documented
  in `03-skills/README.md`, `CATALOG.md`, and `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`. Brings
  the canonical bundled-skill count to **9**.
- Stop/SubagentStop hook input fields `background_tasks` and `session_crons`
  (v2.1.145) — hook authors can read these to decide whether to block stop
  while background work or scheduled tasks are still pending. Documented in
  `06-hooks/README.md`.
- `claude agents --json` (v2.1.145) — print the agent list as machine-readable
  JSON for scripting (status bars, session pickers, tmux-resurrect).
  Documented in `10-cli/README.md`.
- Five hook-event rows that were missing from summary tables — `Setup`,
  `UserPromptExpansion`, `PermissionDenied`, `PostToolBatch` (the narrative
  already claimed "29 events"; the summary tables in `CATALOG.md`,
  `claude_concepts_guide.md`, and `INDEX.md` only listed 25).

### Behavior changes

- **`/model` is session-only by default (v2.1.144)**: selecting a model now
  applies only to the current session; press `d` after selecting to set the
  choice as the new default for future sessions. Documented in
  `01-slash-commands/README.md`.
- **Bash bare env-var auto-approve closed (v2.1.145 security fix)**: a
  command of the form `FOO=bar somecommand` is no longer auto-approved when
  only `FOO=bar` was on the allowlist. Re-allow such commands explicitly via
  `Bash(...)` permission rules that cover the full command. Documented in
  `06-hooks/README.md`.
- **`context: fork` infinite-loop fix (v2.1.145)**: a skill using
  `context: fork` could previously trigger an infinite re-invocation loop in
  rare cases. Documented as a note in `03-skills/README.md`.

### Documentation

- Caught up six root-level reference docs from v2.1.138 to v2.1.145:
  `LEARNING-ROADMAP.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `INDEX.md`, `resources.md`,
  `claude_concepts_guide.md`, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
- Fixed the bundled-skills mismatch — `CATALOG.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, and
  `03-skills/README.md` previously listed three different 5-item lists;
  reconciled to the canonical 9 (`/batch`, `/claude-api`, `/debug`,
  `/fewer-permission-prompts`, `/loop`, `/run`, `/run-skill-generator`,
  `/simplify`, `/verify`). The `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` cell had also incorrectly
  listed `/voice` and `/browse` as bundled skills — neither is bundled.
- Renamed "New Features (March 2026)" → "New Features (May 2026)" in
  `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` and `resources.md` to match the rest of the repo.
- Bumped the version badge in `README.md` from `2.1.138` to `2.1.145` and
  updated the two "latest: v2.1.138" claims in the body.
- Updated the STYLE_GUIDE sample metadata footer from `2.1.97` to `2.1.145`
  so contributors copy the current version.

## [v2.1.143] — 2026-05-19

### Synced to Claude Code v2.1.143

Bumps tutorial coverage from Claude Code v2.1.138 → v2.1.143 (May 15, 2026
release). Anthropic shipped five patches (v2.1.139–v2.1.143) since the last
sync. Highlights: `/goal` and `/scroll-speed` slash commands, the `claude
agents` Agent View (Research Preview) with a full dispatch flag set, a Stop
hook safety cap, hook exec form (`args`), `continueOnBlock` for PostToolUse,
hook `terminalSequence` output, Fast Mode defaulting to Opus 4.7,
PowerShell-by-default on Windows for Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry, and the
`worktree.bgIsolation` setting.

### Added

- `/goal <statement>` slash command (v2.1.139) — registers a session-level
  completion condition with a live overlay panel showing elapsed time, turn
  count, and token usage. Documented in `01-slash-commands/README.md` and
  cross-linked from `10-cli/README.md`.
- `/scroll-speed <±N>` slash command (v2.1.139) — tunes TUI live-preview
  scroll speed; persists per-machine. Documented in
  `01-slash-commands/README.md`.
- `claude agents` Agent View (Research Preview, v2.1.139) with dispatch flags
  `--cwd` (v2.1.141), `--add-dir`, `--settings`, `--mcp-config`,
  `--plugin-dir`, `--permission-mode`, `--model`, `--effort`,
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (v2.1.142). Documented in
  `10-cli/README.md`.
- `claude plugin details <name>` (v2.1.139) — full plugin inventory plus
  projected per-turn/per-invocation token-cost estimate. LSP servers added
  to the details pane in v2.1.142. Documented in `07-plugins/README.md`.
- Marketplace context-cost projection in the `/plugin` browse pane (v2.1.143).
  Documented in `07-plugins/README.md`.
- Hook **exec form** (`args: string[]`, v2.1.139) — direct `execve()` spawn
  with no shell parsing; mutually exclusive with the shell-form `command`
  field. Documented in `06-hooks/README.md`.
- Hook `continueOnBlock: true` field on PostToolUse (v2.1.139) — surfaces a
  blocked tool result back to Claude as a `tool_result` instead of aborting
  the turn. Documented in `06-hooks/README.md`.
- Hook `terminalSequence` JSON output field (v2.1.141) — emits raw OSC escape
  sequences for desktop notifications, window titles, and bells. Documented
  in `06-hooks/README.md`.
- `worktree.bgIsolation: "none"` setting (v2.1.143) — background sessions
  edit the current working copy directly instead of an isolated worktree.
  Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is now passed to every MCP stdio server's environment
  (v2.1.139), and `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` substitution is supported in plugin
  and project `.mcp.json` `command`/`args`/`env` fields. Documented in
  `05-mcp/README.md`.
- Subagent OTEL headers `x-claude-code-agent-id` and
  `x-claude-code-parent-agent-id` (v2.1.139), exposed as
  `agent_id` / `parent_agent_id` attributes on `claude_code.llm_request`
  OTEL spans. Documented in `04-subagents/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OPUS_4_6_FAST_MODE_OVERRIDE=1` (v2.1.142) — pin Fast Mode back
  to Opus 4.6 after the v2.1.142 default flipped to Opus 4.7. Documented in
  `10-cli/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=0` and
  `CLAUDE_CODE_POWERSHELL_RESPECT_EXECUTION_POLICY=1` (v2.1.143) — opt out of
  the default-on PowerShell tool, or make it honor the system execution
  policy instead of `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`. Documented in
  `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP` (v2.1.143) — override the 8-consecutive-
  blocks safety cap for Stop hooks (set `0` to disable). Documented in
  `06-hooks/README.md` and `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_PREFER_HTTPS=1` (v2.1.141) — force plugin installs to
  clone GitHub plugin sources over HTTPS for CI runners without SSH keys.
  Documented in `07-plugins/README.md`.
- `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID` (v2.1.141) — scopes a federated workload-identity
  token to a specific workspace. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- Root-level `SKILL.md` plugin pattern (v2.1.142) — a plugin with only a
  top-level `SKILL.md` (no `skills/` subdirectory) is surfaced as a single
  skill. Documented in `07-plugins/README.md`.
- Plugins marketing name **Routines** for `/schedule` (Anthropic blog,
  2026-05-14) — surfaced as a one-line note in
  `09-advanced-features/README.md`; the CLI surface remains `/schedule`.

### Behavior changes

- **Fast Mode default flipped to Opus 4.7 (v2.1.142)**: `/fast` now runs Opus
  4.7 by default (was Opus 4.6). Set `CLAUDE_CODE_OPUS_4_6_FAST_MODE_OVERRIDE=1`
  to opt back in.
- **PowerShell tool enabled by default on Windows for Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry
  (v2.1.143)**: Claude Code invokes PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`.
  Opt out with `CLAUDE_CODE_POWERSHELL_RESPECT_EXECUTION_POLICY=1` (honor
  system policy) or `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=0` (disable the tool).
- **Remote Control, `/schedule`, claude.ai MCP connectors, and notification
  preferences auto-disabled when API-key auth is set (v2.1.139)**: setting
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, or `apiKeyHelper` disables all
  four claude.ai-bridged surfaces, even if a claude.ai login is also active.
- **Stop hook block loops capped at 8 consecutive blocks (v2.1.143)**: the
  session ends with a warning after 8 in a row, preventing buggy Stop hooks
  from looping the session forever. Override with
  `CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP`.
- **`subagent_type` matching is now case- and separator-insensitive (v2.1.140)**:
  `code-reviewer`, `Code Reviewer`, and `code_reviewer` all resolve to the
  same agent. Documented in `04-subagents/README.md`.

### Changed

- Root reference docs (`README.md`, `CATALOG.md`) updated from `28 hook
  events` to `29 hook events` — matches `06-hooks/README.md` and
  `LEARNING-ROADMAP.md` after the `Setup` hook landed in v2.1.138.

### Notes for translators

- Tutorial translations (`vi/`, `ja/`, `uk/`, `zh/`) follow English; sync
  this round's deltas in module READMEs and the CHANGELOG above. Footers
  must reflect `Last Updated: May 19, 2026` and `Claude Code Version: 2.1.143`.

## [v2.1.138] — 2026-05-09

### Synced to Claude Code v2.1.138

Bumps tutorial coverage from Claude Code v2.1.131 → v2.1.138 (May 9, 2026
release). Anthropic shipped seven patches between v2.1.132 and v2.1.138 since
the last sync.

### Added (English docs)

- `worktree.baseRef` setting (v2.1.133) — controls whether `claude --worktree`
  branches from `origin/<default>` (`"fresh"`, default) or local `HEAD`
  (`"head"`). **Behavior change**: the `"fresh"` default reverts the v2.1.128
  behavior, so users who relied on local-`HEAD` branching after v2.1.128 must
  opt back in. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `autoMode.hard_deny` admin key (v2.1.136) — array of classifier rules that
  block a class of actions regardless of inferred user intent. Use for
  actions that must never run in auto mode (e.g., `rm -rf /`, force-push to
  protected branches). Unlike `soft_deny`, hard-deny rules are not negotiable
  by the classifier. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `parentSettingsBehavior` admin key (v2.1.133+, admin-tier) — controls how
  the SDK's `managedSettings` merges with parent-process settings.
  `"first-wins"` keeps existing precedence; `"merge"` deep-merges values.
  Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `Setup` hook event — initial environment setup (one-time per session); use
  to provision tooling or install deps. Brings the documented hook-events
  total from 28 to 29. Documented in `06-hooks/README.md`.
- `effort.level` field in hook input JSON (v2.1.133) — exposes the active
  effort level (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`) to hooks. Documented in
  `06-hooks/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` environment variable in Bash subprocesses
  (v2.1.132) — session UUID matching the `session_id` field in hook input
  JSON, for correlating bash logs with hook telemetry. Documented in
  `06-hooks/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_EFFORT` environment variable in Bash subprocesses (v2.1.133) —
  active effort level, matching `effort.level` in hook input JSON. Documented
  in `06-hooks/README.md`.
- `sandbox.bwrapPath` and `sandbox.socatPath` settings (v2.1.133+, Linux/WSL)
  — point Claude Code at non-standard install locations for `bubblewrap` and
  `socat`. Default to `$PATH` lookup. Documented in
  `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN` environment variable (v2.1.132).
  Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FEEDBACK_SURVEY_FOR_OTEL` environment variable
  (v2.1.136) — re-enables the session-quality survey for organizations
  capturing OpenTelemetry data; off by default in OTEL deployments.
  Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.

### Changed

- **Behavior change**: Plan mode now blocks all file writes unconditionally
  (v2.1.136), including when a matching `Edit(...)` rule exists in
  `permissions.allow`. Previously a permissive `Edit(...)` rule could let
  writes through in plan mode; that bypass is closed. Workflows that
  depended on the older behavior must exit plan mode (`Shift+Tab`) before
  editing. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- Plugin spaced slash commands (e.g., `/myplugin review`) now resolve to
  `/myplugin:review`. Plugin `skills` config entries no longer hide the
  default `skills/` directory — both are merged. Documented in
  `07-plugins/README.md`.
- MCP servers now persist across `/clear` (v2.1.132+). Documented in
  `05-mcp/README.md`.
- Subagents discover project, user, and plugin skills via the Skill tool
  (v2.1.133). Documented in `04-subagents/README.md`.
- `--permission-mode` is now honored when resuming plan-mode sessions
  (v2.1.132). Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `CronList` output now includes the qualifier(s) and the scheduled prompt
  body (v2.1.136), so you can audit what each cron will run without opening
  it. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.

### Fixed

- OAuth refresh-token concurrent-refresh race condition.
- INDEX.md count drift: Skills 28 → 16, Plugins 40 → 27, Hooks scripts
  8 → 9 (recounted from the markdown content tree). The new totals reflect a
  `.md`-only methodology that scopes counts to tutorial content rather than
  build artifacts and config.
- Stale source URLs in `CATALOG.md` (v2.1.118 → v2.1.138) and
  `claude_concepts_guide.md` (v2.1.117 → v2.1.138). Removed a duplicate
  legacy footer in the concepts guide.

## [v2.1.131] — 2026-05-06

### Synced to Claude Code v2.1.131

Bumps tutorial coverage from Claude Code v2.1.126 → v2.1.131 (May 6, 2026
release). Anthropic shipped v2.1.128, v2.1.129, and v2.1.131 since the last
sync; v2.1.127 and v2.1.130 were skipped and never released publicly.

### Added (English docs)

- `--plugin-url <url>` flag (v2.1.129) — fetches a plugin `.zip` archive from
  a URL for the current session. Repeatable. Documented in
  `07-plugins/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_SYNC_OUTPUT` env var (v2.1.129) — forces synchronous
  output for terminals where auto-detection misses (e.g., Emacs `eat`).
  Documented in `10-cli/README.md` and `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_PACKAGE_MANAGER_AUTO_UPDATE` env var (v2.1.129) — enables
  background upgrades for Homebrew/WinGet installs (which normally do not
  auto-update). Documented in `10-cli/README.md` and
  `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY` env var (v2.1.129) — required
  to opt in to `/v1/models` gateway discovery (see Changed). Documented in
  `10-cli/README.md`.
- `disableRemoteControl` setting (v2.1.128) — admins can block
  `claude remote-control` and `/remote-control` via managed/policy scope.
  Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `--plugin-dir` accepts `.zip` archives (v2.1.128) — alongside directory
  inputs. Documented in `07-plugins/README.md`.
- `skillOverrides` accepts `"name-only"` and `"user-invocable-only"`
  (v2.1.129) — in addition to the previous `"on"`/`"off"`. Documented in
  `03-skills/README.md`.

### Changed

- **Behavior change**: Gateway `/v1/models` discovery is now **opt-in**
  (v2.1.129). Previously (v2.1.126), setting `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` automatically
  populated `/model` from the gateway's `/v1/models` endpoint. From v2.1.129,
  users must additionally set `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1`;
  without the env var, `/model` falls back to the built-in static list.
  Documented in `10-cli/README.md`.
- `/mcp` shows tool count per server and visually flags servers reporting 0
  tools (v2.1.128). Documented in `05-mcp/README.md`.
- Bare `/color` (no args) picks a random session color (v2.1.128); explicit
  `/color <name|hex>` continues to set a specific color. Documented in
  `01-slash-commands/README.md`.
- `--channels` flag now works with API-key (console) authentication
  (v2.1.128). Earlier releases required Pro/Max OAuth. Documented in
  `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- Ctrl+R history picker defaults to **all prompts across all projects**
  (v2.1.129). Press Ctrl+S inside the picker to narrow scope to the current
  project. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- `/context` no longer dumps its ASCII visualization into the conversation
  (v2.1.129). The viz is shown in-UI only; no more ~1.6k token cost per
  invocation. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md`.
- Oversized images in drag-and-drop are auto-downscaled (v2.1.128) — earlier
  versions rejected images outright.

### Fixed

- VS Code extension activation on Windows (v2.1.131).
- Mantle endpoint authentication (v2.1.131).
- 1-hour prompt-cache TTL no longer truncated to 5 minutes (v2.1.129).
- Crash on stdin payloads larger than 10 MB (v2.1.128).

## [v2.1.126] — 2026-05-02

### Synced to Claude Code v2.1.126

Bumps tutorial coverage from Claude Code v2.1.119 → v2.1.126 (May 1, 2026 release).
v2.1.120 was rolled back on its first release day (2026-04-24) but re-released
successfully on 2026-04-28 with the originally-reported regressions fixed.
v2.1.124 and v2.1.125 were skipped by Anthropic and never released.

### Added (English docs)

- `claude project purge [path]` subcommand (v2.1.126) — deletes all Claude Code
  state for a project (transcripts, tasks, debug logs, file-edit history,
  prompt history, `~/.claude.json` entry). Supports `--dry-run`, `-y/--yes`,
  `-i/--interactive`, `--all`. Documented in `10-cli/README.md`.
- `claude plugin prune` subcommand (v2.1.121) — removes orphaned auto-installed
  plugin dependencies; `plugin uninstall --prune` cascades. Documented in
  `07-plugins/README.md`.
- `claude ultrareview [target]` subcommand (v2.1.120) — runs `/ultrareview`
  non-interactively from CI/scripts, prints findings to stdout, exits 0/1 on
  success/failure; supports `--json` and `--timeout <minutes>`. Documented in
  `10-cli/README.md`.
- `${CLAUDE_EFFORT}` placeholder available inside skill content (v2.1.120) —
  resolves to the current effort level. Documented in `03-skills/README.md`.
- `alwaysLoad` MCP server config option (v2.1.121) — when `true`, all tools
  from that server skip tool-search deferral. Documented in `05-mcp/README.md`.
- `PostToolUse.hookSpecificOutput.updatedToolOutput` now works for all tools
  (v2.1.121), previously MCP-only. Documented in `06-hooks/README.md`.
- `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_SERVICE_TIER` environment variable (v2.1.122) — selects
  Bedrock service tier (`default`, `flex`, `priority`). Documented in
  `10-cli/README.md` env-var table.
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` extended-path coverage (v2.1.121, v2.1.126)
  — now bypasses prompts for writes to `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`,
  `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/`, `.git/`, `.vscode/`, shell config files.
  Catastrophic removal commands (`rm -rf /` etc.) still prompt. Documented in
  `09-advanced-features/README.md` permission-modes section.
- OAuth code paste fallback (v2.1.126) — `claude auth login` accepts the OAuth
  code pasted into the terminal when the browser callback can't reach
  localhost (WSL2, SSH, containers). Documented in `10-cli/README.md`.
- Type-to-filter `/skills` menu (v2.1.121). Documented in `03-skills/README.md`.
- `AI_AGENT` environment variable (v2.1.120) — set on subprocesses so `gh` can
  attribute traffic to Claude Code. Documented in `10-cli/README.md` env-var
  table.

### Changed

- `--from-pr` (v2.1.119) and `/resume` PR-URL search (v2.1.122) now both
  support GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, and Bitbucket URLs.
- Windows: Git for Windows / Git Bash no longer required (v2.1.120) — Claude
  Code uses PowerShell as the shell tool when Git Bash is absent. From v2.1.126,
  PowerShell is the primary shell when the PowerShell tool is enabled. Detection
  extended to PowerShell 7 installed via Microsoft Store, MSI without PATH, or
  `.NET global tool`. Documented in `09-advanced-features/README.md` platform
  notes.
- `/model` picker now lists models from your gateway's `/v1/models` endpoint
  when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points at an Anthropic-compatible gateway
  (v2.1.126). Documented in `10-cli/README.md`.
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` no longer prompts for writes to a much
  broader allowlist (see Added). Catastrophic removals still prompt.
- Image paste auto-downscale (v2.1.126) — images larger than 2000px are
  downscaled on paste; oversized images in history are auto-removed and the
  request retried. (Tutorial-relevant only as a safety/UX note.)

### Security

- Fixed `allowManagedDomainsOnly` / `allowManagedReadPathsOnly` being ignored
  when a higher-priority managed-settings source lacked a `sandbox` block
  (v2.1.126).

## [v2.4.0] — 2026-04-27

### Synced to Claude Code v2.1.119

Bumps tutorial coverage from Claude Code v2.1.112 → v2.1.119 (April 23, 2026 release).
v2.1.120 was published April 24, briefly rolled back the same day due to regressions,
and re-released on April 28 with fixes — it is now part of the normal release line.

- Plugin marketplace enforcement on every lifecycle event (v2.1.117) and `hostPattern`/`pathPattern` regex (v2.1.119)
- New env vars: `DISABLE_UPDATES`, `CLAUDE_CODE_HIDE_CWD`, `CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT`, `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS`, `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` Vertex opt-in
- New slash commands: `/btw`, `/theme` with custom themes
- `/usage` canonical command (merges `/cost` + `/stats`, v2.1.118)
- Forked subagents (`CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT=1`, v2.1.117)
- Auto mode `"$defaults"` token (v2.1.118)
- `wslInheritsWindowsSettings` managed policy (v2.1.118)
- Vim visual / visual-line modes (v2.1.118)
- `claude install [version]` and `claude plugin tag` subcommands

### Changed

- Documentation host migrated: `docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/*` → `code.claude.com/docs/en/*`
- Opus 4.7 effort levels: `xhigh` is now the Claude Code default since the 2026-04-16 launch; Opus 4.7 native context window confirmed at 1M (v2.1.117 fixed `/context` miscounting it as 200K)
- Default effort raised from `medium` to `high` for Pro/Max subscribers on Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6 (v2.1.117)
- `STYLE_GUIDE.md` Source URL updated from Claude Apps article to `code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog`
